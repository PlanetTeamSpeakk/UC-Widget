# UC-Widget
UCs are codes used in the Netherlands (for a fact, not sure about other countries) by supermarkets to tell the stock clerks when to remove a product from the store. It is basically the same as a date, but not meant to be understood by the average customer.

This widget is supposed to help stock clerks find out what today's UC is to make sure they remove the right products and not newer ones.

UC stands for 'Uithaal Code' which translates to removal code which is self explanatory for what it's meant for.

Supposedly supports all devices running Connect IQ 2.4+

Since it may be a bit confusing for people who just got their Garmin device (like me, I got mine 2 weeks before writing this and had this problem), you may not have a clue where you can change settings of watch faces, apps, widgets and data fields, so I shall tell you now where to find it.

1. Open the Garmin Connect app.

2. Press the three stripes button in the top left corner and click on Garmin Devices at the bottom.

3. Select your device.

4. Select either 'Activities, Apps & More' to change settings of apps and data fields or 'Appearance' for watch faces and widgets.

5. Select the widget/watch face/ data field/app you want to customise.

6. If the app has settings, a settings button should appear below the 'View in store' button, click it and edit anything to your liking.

The formats you can use that will be changed to current values are as follows:

{WEEK} The current week number.

{DAY_LETTER} The letter corresponding to the day number.

{DAY_NO} The number of the current day in the current week.

{DAY_MONTH} The current day of the month.

{YEAR} The full year.

{YEAR_SHORT} The last 2 digits of the current year.

{MONTH_NO} The number of the current month.

{MONTH_SHORT} The 3 letter abbreviated name of the current month.

{MONTH_LONG} The full name of the current month.

{TIME_EPOCH} The time in seconds since 1 January 1970.

{TIME_24H} The current time showing hours and minutes in HH:MM 24 hour format.

{TIME_12H} The current time showing hours and minutes in HH:MM AM/PM 12 hour format.

The default format is {WEEK}-{DAY_LETTER} which results in e.g. 36-D on 5 September.
